# UI-of-github-repository
Design of a website that displays the public Github repositories belonging to any specific user.
The webpage has a header section (<div class="head">) containing information about John Savill, including his name, bio, location, website, and a link to his GitHub profile.
There is a circular element in the header (<div class="circle">), which seems to be a design element.
The main content of the page is organized into rows (<div class="row1">) and columns (<div class="col">). Each column represents a set of "Heroes" with a title, description, and a list of topics related to JavaScript and Angular.The webpage features a footer (<div class="footer">) with a container for page limit selection and index buttons for pagination.
Within the footer, there is a dropdown menu (<select>) for selecting the number of repositories to display and index buttons for navigating between pages. The page includes JavaScript files (<script> tags) for functionality, including a custom script (script.js) and dependencies such as jQuery and Bootstrap.It's important to note that there is a duplicate inclusion of the jQuery library; you may consider removing one of them to avoid redundancy.The Bootstrap and Popper.js libraries are also included for styling and additional functionality.
The code seems to be a part of a larger project aimed at presenting GitHub repository information in a user-friendly manner.
